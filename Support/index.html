        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how SuiteKeep ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application (the "Service").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>

        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <p>We use the information you provide to:</p>

            <li>Respond to your support requests and inquiries</li>
            <li>Improve our application based on user feedback</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Local Storage</h3>
        <p>Your concert and suite management data is stored locally on your device using secure iOS storage mechanisms. This data remains under your control and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

        <h3>3.2 CloudKit Integration</h3>
        <p>When you enable iCloud sync, your data is stored in your personal Apple iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit service. This data is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encrypted in transit and at rest by Apple</li>
            <li>Associated with your Apple ID, not accessible by us</li>
            <li>Subject to Apple's privacy policies and security measures</li>
            <li>Synchronized only between your own devices</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Data Security</h3>
        <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Local data encryption on your device</li>
            <li>Secure communication protocols for support requests</li>
            <li>No server-side storage of your personal concert data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Information Sharing</h2>

        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties. Your concert and suite management data stays on your devices and in your personal iCloud account.</p>

        <h3>4.1 Support Communications</h3>
        <p>When you contact us for support, we may use your provided email address to respond to your inquiries. These communications are handled securely and are not shared with third parties.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, or legal process, or to protect our rights, property, or safety.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Data Control</h3>
        <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All data is stored locally on your device or in your personal iCloud</li>
            <li>You can disable iCloud sync at any time in the app settings</li>
            <li>You can create manual backups of your data</li>
            <li>You can delete all data through the app's "Clear All Data" feature</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Data Portability</h3>
        <p>You can export your data at any time using the app's backup feature, which creates a comprehensive file of all your concerts, settings, and preferences.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>Our Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <h3>7.1 Apple CloudKit</h3>
        <p>Our app uses Apple's CloudKit service for optional data synchronization. CloudKit is governed by Apple's Privacy Policy, available at: https://www.apple.com/privacy/</p>

        <h3>7.2 No Analytics or Advertising</h3>
        <p>SuiteKeep does not integrate with analytics services, advertising networks, or other third-party tracking services.</p>

        <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>

        <p>Since your data is stored locally on your device and in your personal iCloud account, data transfers are handled by Apple according to their privacy policies and international data handling practices.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date above. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>10. Data Retention</h2>

        <p>Your data is retained as long as you keep the app installed and maintain your data. When you delete the app or clear all data, your information is permanently removed from your device. iCloud data follows Apple's retention policies.</p>

        <h2>11. California Privacy Rights</h2>

        <p>If you are a California resident, you have certain rights regarding your personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Since we don't collect personal information for commercial purposes and don't share data with third parties, most CCPA provisions don't apply. However, you always maintain full control over your data through the app's built-in features.</p>
